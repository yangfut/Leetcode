## Concept


### Backtrack

Two types of backtrack: Permutation and Subset.
Permutation is to create a constant length but unique sub array. Subset is to create unique but not constatn sub array.

(1). Backtrack in Permutation is to create multiple loops by visited table(dashboard) and recursion.
(2). Backtrack in Subset is to create take or not-take condition by include/exclude recursion and using idx for every recursive function.
